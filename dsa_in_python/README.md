`Teacher's note`

This course is meant to teach you Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in python. DSA is a classic "foundation" course, in the sense that it does not have a direct relation to a lot of career options, unlike some course labeled "Data Analytics". Just like how Organic Chemistry is the bread & butter of any Chemist, such is DSA to programmers. It's useful to have a firm grasp on algorithmic approaches to different types of data, and could come in handy in a lot of different scenarios (data engineers, especially, where you have to structure data, compress, encode, decode, yadda yadda). For those of you with a background in Java or C++, it could be useful to see the "pythonic" ways of approaching similar problems.

The course expects a good background in Python. As a benchmark, I'd say a solid understanding of coursework `06/05 - 07/10` of the `data_science_in_python` course would be enough (about 1 month of experience).
